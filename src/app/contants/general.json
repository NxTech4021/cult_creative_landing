We’ve cultivated a pool of diverse and talented creators, to give you the best opportunity of finding the right influencer for your brand. With TRIBE, influencers will browse your campaign, create the content and submit your brief. You can then view the submissions to assess which posts and influencers best fit your campaign, and purchase the posts you love. If you want to know if an influencer is right for your business, you can simply click through to their social feed to get a better idea of their tone of voice, engagement and brand-fit."

    "answer": "Each creator submission will include their pitch, fee, bio, portfolio, profile and estimated performance metrics. You’ll be able to chat directly with creators to provide any feedback or collaborate before pre-approving those you want to work with. Pre-approval commits you to 50% of their fees and gives creators the go-ahead to create and submit their final content. Once they’ve resubmitted, go ahead and approve the post and the creators will publish it to their social-media account."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do I do if I haven’t received any new submissions to my TRIBE campaign?",

We can spend some time looking at the requirements and target influencers that we know will best encourage more submissions and approvals."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I pay for the influencer content, do I own it?",
    "answer": "You can repost on your own social-media channels with credit but if you’re looking for beautiful content for your paid media channels we can organize that for you too. Here are your options: (1) You can run a content campaign where creators craft content but don’t post it to their channels. Instead, you license it directly. (2) You can request to license any piece of content from any of your campaigns from your content library. (3) You can boost your top-performing posts from your influencer campaigns to run branded content ads on Meta or spark ads on TikTok."
