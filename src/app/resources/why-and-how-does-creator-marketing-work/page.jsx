          Here’s the short answer: people no longer want brands to simply sell to them.
        </rc.p>
        <rc.p>
          By leveraging the influence and credibility of content creators or influencers to promote products or brands to their audience, brands have the unique opportunity to reach and engage with a highly targeted and receptive customer base. Why? Because the audience already has a connection with the creator, making their recommendations and endorsements more powerful and persuasive.

        <rc.p>
          As consumers increasingly seek genuine and relatable experiences, influencer marketing allows brands to partner with creators who produce content that resonates with their target audience.

        <rc.h2>Key Reasons That Creator Marketing Works</rc.h2>
