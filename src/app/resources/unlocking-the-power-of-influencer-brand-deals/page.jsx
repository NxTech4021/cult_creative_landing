            Influencer and User-Generated Content (UGC) marketing is growing rapidly in Malaysia. Brands begin to recognise the power that social media users have in boosting their brand awareness, customer engagement, and ultimately, sales.

          <rc.p>
            This new form of marketing has become an integral part of the marketing strategy for many businesses. By leveraging the fame and reputation of popular social media figures such as TikTokers, YouTubers, and Instagrammers, brands tap into new audiences and create a sense of authenticity in their marketing campaigns.

            As a regular social media creator and content creator, you could take advantage of this growing marketing trend to secure your next brand deal.

          <rc.h2>How Can You, as a Content Creator, Start Unlocking Brand Deals?</rc.h2>
          <rc.p>
            It might be overwhelming to start. But firstly, begin small and identify your niche. If it’s an area that you’re an expert in or have a passion/interest in, then that’s where you can find your place. Creators can then carry on by creating high quality and engaging content that resonates with followers.
          </rc.p>
          <rc.p>
            Secondly, as a content creator, work on building your reputation and credibility by consistently delivering valuable content and engaging with your audience.
          </rc.p>
          <rc.p>
            That means posting consistently and speaking to your audience. Engaging with them, answering comments and replies, and learning more from them about their needs and desires.
          </rc.p>
          <rc.p>
            Thirdly, you can also consider joining influencer marketing platforms or agencies that connect you with brands. These platforms provide opportunities for content creators to gain access to a wider range of brand collaborations, showcase your talents, and increase earning potential and a side income.
